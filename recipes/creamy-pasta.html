    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>200g pasta of your choice (<i>we use spaghetti, but your choice might change depending on the veg and meat you add)</i></li>
        <li>400 ml double cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 - 3 garlic cloves, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 portobello mushrooms, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/2 to a 1 lemon, depending on how much acidity you would like</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the double cream to a pot on low heat with a pinch of salt. <strong>Do not bring the sauce to a boil.</strong></li>
        <li>Add the garlic to some cooking oil in a pan over a medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the garlic becomes aromatic, add the diced onion. Sauté until translucent</li>
        <li>Add the mushroom, and lower to medium-low heat whilst continuing to sauté.</li>
        <li>Grate Parmesan cheese into the cream and stir. Taste regularly until satisfied.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in a pot with boiling water - add salt</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and sauce to the pan with the veg and mix well. Add a small amount of pasta water - don't worry about adding too much, you can always just let the mix reduce for a few minutes!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And done! Serve with some basil and sliced lemon to garnish - just like that, you've got yourself a delicious, fresh, homemade pasta dish!</p>
